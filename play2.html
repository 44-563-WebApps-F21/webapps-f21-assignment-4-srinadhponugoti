        <h4 class="name">LADY MARKBY.</h4>  
        <P class="speech markby">Oh! I have brought a much more charming person than Sir
        John.  Sir John’s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has
        become quite unbearable.  Really, now that the House of Commons is trying
        to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.</P>

        <h4 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  
        <p class="speech robert">I hope not, Lady Markby.  At any rate we do our
        best to waste the public time, don’t we?  But who is this charming person
        you have been kind enough to bring to us?</p>

        <h4 class="name">LADY MARKBY.</h4>  
        <p class="speech markby">Her name is Mrs. Cheveley!  One of the Dorsetshire
        Cheveleys, I suppose.  But I really don’t know.  Families are so mixed
        nowadays.  Indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else.</p>

        <h4 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  
        <p class="speech robert">Mrs. Cheveley?  I seem to know the name.</p>

        <h4 class="name">LADY MARKBY.></h4>  
        <p class="speech markby">She has just arrived from Vienna.</p>

        <h4 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  
        <p  class="speech robert">Ah! yes.  I think I know whom you mean.</p>

        <h4 class="name">LADY MARKBY.</h4>
        <p class="speech markby"> Oh! she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant
        scandals about all her friends.  I really must go to Vienna next winter.
        I hope there is a good chef at the Embassy.</p>

        <h4 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>
        <p class="speech robert"> If there is not, the Ambassador will certainly have
        to be recalled.  Pray point out Mrs. Cheveley to me.  I should like to
        see her.</p>

        <h4 class="name">LADY MARKBY.</h4>  
        <p class="speech markby">Let me introduce you.</p>p>
        [_To_ MRS. CHEVELEY.]  
        <p>My dear, Sir Robert Chiltern is dying to know you!</p>

        <h4 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h4>  
        [_Bowing_.]  
        <p class="speech robert">Every one is dying to know the
        brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.  Our attachés at Vienna write to us about
        nothing else.</p>

        <h4 class="name">MRS. CHEVELEY.</h4>  
        <p class="speech cheveley">Thank you, Sir Robert.  An acquaintance that begins with
        a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.  It starts in the
        right manner.  And I find that I know Lady Chiltern already.</p>
