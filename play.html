        <h3>  SCENE</h3>


        _The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house in Grosvenor Square_.

        <p class="stage-direction">[_The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_. _At the top of
        the staircase stands_ LADY CHILTERN, _a woman of grave Greek beauty_,
        _about twenty-seven years of age_. _She receives the guests as they come
        up_. _Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
        lights_, _which illumine a large eighteenth-century French
        tapestry—representing the Triumph of Love_, _from a design by
        Boucher—that is stretched on the staircase wall_. _On the right is the
        entrance to the music-room_. _The sound of a string quartette is faintly
        heard_. _The entrance on the left leads to other reception-rooms_. MRS.
        MARCHMONT _and_ LADY BASILDON, _two very pretty women_, _are seated
        together on a Louis Seize sofa_. _They are types of exquisite
        fragility_. _Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm_.
        _Watteau would have loved to paint them_.]</p>

        <h4 class="name"> MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>
       <p class="marchmont">Going on to the Hartlocks’ to-night, Margaret?</p>

        <h4 class="name"> LADY BASILDON.</h4> 
         <p class="speech basildon">I suppose so. Are you?</p>

        <h4 class="name"> MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>  
        <p class="speech marchmont">Yes. Horribly tedious parties they give, don’t they?</p>

        <h4 class="name"> LADY BASILDON.</h4>  
        <p class="speech basildon">Horribly tedious! Never know why I go. Never know why I
        go anywhere.</p>

        <h4 class="name"> MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4> 
        <p class="speech marchmont">I come here to be educated.</p>

        <h4 class="name"> LADY BASILDON.</h4>  
        <p class="speech basildon">Ah! I hate being educated!</p>

        <h4 class="name"> MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4> 
        <p class="speech marchmont"> So do I. It puts one almost on a level with the
        commercial classes, doesn’t it? But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always
        telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life. So I come
        here to try to find one.</p>

        <h4 class="name"> LADY BASILDON.</h4> 
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Looking round through her lorgnette_.]</p>
            <p class="speech lady"> I don’t seeanybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose.
        The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
        time.</p>

        <h4 class="name"> MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>  
        <p class="speech marchmont">How very trivial of him!</p>

        <h4 class="name"> LADY BASILDON.</h4> 
        <p class="speech lady"> Terribly trivial! What did your man talk about/</p>

        <h4 class="name"> MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4> 
        <p class="speech marchmont"> About myself.</p>

        <h4 class="name"> LADY BASILDON.</h4>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Languidly_.]</p>
            <p class="speech lady"> And were you interested?</p>

        <h4 class="name"> MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Shaking her head_.]</p> 
        <p class="speech marchmont">Not in the smallest degree.</p>

        <h4 class="name"> LADY BASILDON.</h4>  
        <p class="speech lady">What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!</p>

        <h4 class="name"> MRS. MARCHMONT.</h4> 
        <p class="stage-direction"> [_Rising_.]</p>
             <p class="speech marchmont">And how well it becomes us, Olivia!</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[_They rise and go towards the music-room_. _The_ VICOMTE DE NANJAC, _a
        young attaché known for his neckties and his Anglomania_, _approaches
        with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]</p>

       <h4 class="name">  MASON.</h4>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.] </p>
        <p class="speech mason">Mr. and Lady Jane Barford. Lord Caversham.</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
        riband and star of the Garter_. _A fine Whig type_. _Rather like a
        portrait by Lawrence_.]</p>

         <h4 class="name">  LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4> 
        <p class="speech lord">Good evening, Lady Chiltern! Has my good-for-nothing
        young son been here?</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LADY CHILTERN.</h4>  
       <p class="stage-direction">[_Smiling_.] </p>
       <p class="speech lady"> don’t think Lord Goring has arrived yet.</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LMABEL CHILTERN.</h4>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Coming up to_ LORD CAVERSHAM.] </p>
        <p class="speech lmabel">Why do you call Lord Goring good-for-nothing?</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[MABEL CHILTERN _is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness_,
        _the apple-blossom type_. _She has all the fragrance and freedom of a
        flower_. _There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and
        the little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the
        mouth of a child_. _She has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the
        astonishing courage of innocence_. _To sane people she is not
        reminiscent of any work of art_. _But she is really like a Tanagra
        statuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told so_.]</p>

        <h4 class="name">  LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4> 
        <p class="speech lord"> Because he leads such an idle life.</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LMABEL CHILTERN.</h4> 
        <p class="speech lmabel"> How can you say such a thing? Why, he rides in the Row
        at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week,
        changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night
        of the season. You don’t call that leading an idle life, do you?</p>

        <h4 class="name">  LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4> 
         <p class="stage-direction">[_Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes_.]</p>
        <p class="speech lord">You are a very charming young lady!</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LMABEL CHILTERN.</h4> 
         <p class="speech lmabel">How sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham! Do come
        to us more often. You know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you
        look so well with your star!</p>

        <h4 class="name">  LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4>  
        <p class="speech lord">Never go anywhere now. Sick of London Society.
        Shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the
        right side. But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my
        wife’s milliner. Never could stand Lady Caversham’s bonnets.</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LMABEL CHILTERN.</h4> 
       <p class="speech lmabel"> Oh, I love London Society! I think it has immensely
        improved. It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant
        lunatics. Just what Society should be.</p>

        <h4 class="name">  LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4> 
        <p class="speech lord">Hum! Which is Goring? Beautiful idiot, or the other
        thing?</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LMABEL CHILTERN.</h4>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Gravely_.] </p>
        <p class="speech lmabel">I have been obliged for the present to put
        Lord Goring into a class quite by himself. But he is developing
        charmingly!</p>

        <h4 class="name">  LORD CAVERSHAM.</h4> 
        <p class="speech lord"> Into what?</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LMABEL CHILTERN.</h4>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_With a little curtsey_.] </p>
        <p class="speech lord">I hope to let you know very soon, Lord Caversham!</p>

       <h4 class="name">  MASON.</h4>   
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Announcing guests_.] </p>
       <p class="speech mason"> Lady Markby. Mrs. Cheveley.</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ LADY MARKBY _and_ MRS. CHEVELEY. LADY MARKBY _is a pleasant_,
        _kindly_, _popular woman_, _with gray hair à la marquise and good lace_.
        MRS. CHEVELEY, _who accompanies her_, _is tall and rather slight_. _Lips
        very thin and highly-coloured_, _a line of scarlet on a pallid face_.
        _Venetian red hair_, _aquiline nose_, _and long throat_. _Rouge
        accentuates the natural paleness of her complexion_. _Gray-green eyes
        that move restlessly_. _She is in heliotrope_, _with diamonds_. _She
        looks rather like an orchid_, _and makes great demands on one’s
        curiosity_. _In all her movements she is extremely graceful_. _A work
        of art_, _on the whole_, _but showing the influence of too many
        schools_.]</p>

        <h4 class="name">  LADY MARKBY.</h4> 
        <p class="markby markby"> Good evening, dear Gertrude! So kind of you to let me
        bring my friend, Mrs. Cheveley. Two such charming women should know each
        other!</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LADY CHILTERN.</h4>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Advances towards_ MRS. CHEVELEY _with a sweet smile_.
        _Then suddenly stops_, _and bows rather distantly_.]</p> 
        <p class="speech chiltern">I think Mrs.
        Cheveley and I have met before. I did not know she had married a second
        time.</p>

        <h4 class="name">  LADY MARKBY.</h4>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Genially_.] </p>
        <p class="speech markby">Ah, nowadays people marry as often as they
        can, don’t they? It is most fashionable.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_To_ DUCHESS OF MARYBOROUGH.]</p>
        <p class="speech markby">Dear Duchess, and how is the Duke? Brain still weak, I suppose? Well,
        that is only to be expected, is it not? His good father was just the
        same. There is nothing like race, is there?</p>

        <h4 class="name">  MRS. CHEVELEY.</h4>  
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Playing with her fan_.] </p>
        <p class=" speechcheveley">But have we really met before,
        Lady Chiltern? I can’t remember where. I have been out of England for
        so long.</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LADY CHILTERN.</h4>  We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.

        MRS. CHEVELEY 
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Superciliously_.] </p>
        <p class="speech chiltern">Indeed? I have forgotten all about my
        schooldays. I have a vague impression that they were detestable.</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LADY CHILTERN.</h4>  
       <p class="stage-direction">[_Coldly_.] </p>
        <p class="speech chiltern">I am not surprised!</p>

          <h4 class="name">  MRS. CHEVELEY.</h4> 
         <p class="stage-direction">[_In her sweetest manner_.]</p> 
        <p class="speech cheveley">Do you know, I am quite
        looking forward to meeting your clever husband, Lady Chiltern. Since he
        has been at the Foreign Office, he has been so much talked of in Vienna.
        They actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers. That
        in itself is fame, on the continent.</p>

       <h4 class="name">  LADY CHILTERN.</h4>  
        <p class="speech chiltern">I hardly think there will be much in common between you
        and my husband, Mrs. Cheveley! </p>
        <p class="stage-direction">[_Moves away_.]</p>

        <h4 class="name">  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.</h4> 
         <p class="speech vicomte">Ah! chère Madame, quelle surprise! I have not seen
        you since Berlin!</p>

        <h4 class="name">  MRS. CHEVELEY.</h4> 
         <p class="speech cheveley">Not since Berlin, Vicomte. Five years ago!</p>

        <h4 class="name">  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.</h4>  
        <p class="vicomte">And you are younger and more beautiful than ever.
        How do you manage it?</p>

        <h4 class="name">  MRS. CHEVELEY.</h4>  
        <p class="speech cheveley">By making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming
        people like yourself.</p>

        <h4 class="name">  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.</h4> 
        <p class="speech vicomte">Ah! you flatter me. You butter me, as they say here.</p>

        <h4 class="name">  MRS. CHEVELEY.</h4> 
         <p class="speech cheveley">Do they say that here? How dreadful of them!</p>

        <h4 class="name">  VICOMTE DE NANJAC.</h4>  
        <p class="speech vicomte">Yes, they have a wonderful language. It should be
        more widely known.</p>

        <p class="stage-direction">[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _enters_. _A man of forty_, _but looking somewhat
        younger_. _Clean-shaven_, _with finely-cut features_, _dark-haired and
        dark-eyed_. _A personality of mark_. _Not popular—few personalities
        are_. _But intensely admired by the few_, _and deeply respected by the
        many_. _The note of his manner is that of perfect distinction_, _with a
        slight touch of pride_. _One feels that he is conscious of the success
        he has made in life_. _A nervous temperament_, _with a tired look_.
        _The firmly-chiselled mouth and chin contrast strikingly with the
        romantic expression in the deep-set eyes_. _The variance is suggestive
        of an almost complete separation of passion and intellect_, _as though
        thought and emotion were each isolated in its own sphere through some
        violence of will-power_. _There is nervousness in the nostrils_, _and in
        the pale_, _thin_, _pointed hands_. _It would be inaccurate to call him
        picturesque_. _Picturesqueness cannot survive the House of Commons_.
        _But Vandyck would have liked to have painted his head_.]</p>
